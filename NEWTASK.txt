NEW GOAL:

FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS TO MAKE A SAVE FILE WITH ALL THE DATA

The polygon drawer needs to have a "fix" mode - add to context menu
    Must make it obvious, maybe change the theme?
    Once in fix mode, only brings up segmentations if they are available
    otherwise, doesn't allow you to place any points
Need to be able to bring the polygon from the previous slice and draw it as a polygon 
    Has to have a button that says "Bring previous" with a confirmation window

The polygon drawer must also be able to bring up the specific case needed
It can then move between cases, and any polygon data that is drawn must be saved in an appropriate location, so that it can be called up again
When the slice is called up again, the polygon data will be redrawn and made so that it can be edited and saved again
--Pull logic from the viewhelper rewrite  

Need to be able to select the folder in which to save the fixed polygon
Have to be able to click a button in the main app to have the segmentor and the viewhelper have the same case

I want it so that the app can allow you to "focus"purely the viewhelper, segmentor, or both

Maybe make a case window with all the cases within? can make it easier to access everything
yeah that can be the bottom window, 
    so that you can "add case",
    saves the cases name and path, 
    then when clicked, it would ask to load into the viewhelper, drawer, or both
    with both being the main option
